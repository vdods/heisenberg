#### Contents

-   [heisenberg](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg) : Top-level program
    (and module) to explain and redirect to all the specific subprograms of this project.
-   [heisenberg.library](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg/library) :
    A module that contains mostly math-oriented code that is used in multiple subprograms.
-   [heisenberg.plot](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg/plot) :
    Plots an integral curve of the system using given initial condition, optionally running an
    optimization method to find a nearby curve that closes back up on itself.
-   [heisenberg.plot_samples](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg/plot_samples) :
    Provides visualization of the data generated by the heisenberg.sample subprogram.  In particular,
    this gives a colormapped scatterplot of the objective function on the fully reduced, 2-parameter
    initial condition space.
-   [heisenberg.sample](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg/sample) :
    Samples a specified parameter space of initial conditions, computing the corresponding integral
    curves, and computing and storing relevant data about the each curve in a file.  This is intended
    to sample various functions of the initial condition space, and can be used in later processing;
    see the heisenberg.plot_samples subprogram.
-   [heisenberg.search](https://github.com/vdods/heisenberg/tree/master/heisenberg/search) :
    Search a specified parameter space for initial conditions for curves.  Once a curve is found
    that comes close enough to closing back up on itself, an optimization method is used to attempt
    to alter the initial conditions so that the curve closes back up on itself.  The result is
    integral curves which approximate closed solutions to within numerical accuracy.

Additionally, though not still actively part of the project:

#### Invoking Subprograms

The following command, when executed from this project's root directory, will print a directory of
the available subprograms.

    python3 -m heisenberg

Examples of invoking specific subprograms:

    python3 -m heisenberg.plot --dt=0.003 --max-time=23 --initial-3preimage=[0.5,0,1]

    python3 -m heisenberg.search --dt=0.001 --max-time=100 --output-dir=search-output --abortive-subdir=abortive --seed=75912763
